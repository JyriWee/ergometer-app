“All comments and documentation must be in English.”

“Prefer KDoc (/** ... */) for public functions/classes, short inline comments only where non-obvious.”

“Do not restate what the code already says; explain why, invariants, protocol details, edge cases.”

“No behavior changes, no refactors unless required for clarity.”

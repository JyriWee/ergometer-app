“All comments and documentation must be in English.”

“Prefer KDoc (/** ... */) for public functions/classes, short inline comments only where non-obvious.”

“At the end of each coding session, update docs/next-session.md with branch, next task, DoD, risks, and validation commands.”

“For UI/UX tasks, follow docs/ui-workflow-playbook.md. If workflow drifts significantly, remind the user and propose a reset to the playbook steps.”

/**
 * UI-facing snapshot of workout runner state.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - `running=true` means the workout has started and not reached a terminal state.
 * - `paused=true` while `running=true` indicates the workout is paused in place.
 * - `done=true` is terminal and must pair with `running=false`, `paused=true`, and cleared targets.
 * - `workoutElapsedSec` is null outside an active workout lifecycle.
 * - `stepRemainingSec` is null when no active step is available.
 * - `intervalPart` is populated only during interval-origin step parts.

# UI Workflow Playbook (Beginner-Friendly)

## Purpose
Use this process for UI work to reduce rework and keep progress measurable.

## Scope First
Define the usage context before visual details:
- primary device orientation (portrait/landscape)
- typical posture and viewing distance
- top 3 signals the user must read in 1-2 seconds
- primary action and failure action

Do not start with spacing/font tuning before this is written.

## State Matrix Before Layout
List all UI states first, then decide content per state.

Template:
- state name
- trigger into state
- must-show information
- primary action
- waiting/error indicator

For session flows, include at minimum:
- menu
- connecting
- waiting_start
- running
- paused
- stopping
- summary

## Wireframe Before Styling
Create a block-level layout first (paper or simple mock):
- what is top/middle/bottom
- what is always visible
- what can be collapsed

No color/font decisions yet.

## Build Static UI First
Implement structure with static/mock values before live BLE/runtime wiring.

Exit criteria:
- information hierarchy is readable on target tablet
- no critical clipping/wrapping
- controls are discoverable

## Lock One Baseline Early
Pick one baseline mode first and finish it:
- recommended: landscape-first if real usage is mostly landscape
- add secondary orientation after baseline is accepted

This avoids solving two layout problems at the same time.

## Visual Rules Up Front
Set stable visual rules before iterative tweaks:
- spacing scale
- card padding and minimum sizes
- typography sizes for primary/secondary metrics
- dark-mode background and contrast rules
- waiting-state feedback pattern (for example animated dots)

## Validation Loop
Each iteration must produce:
- what changed
- commands run
- screenshot path
- PASS/FAIL result
- next decision

Use short loops and make one decision per loop.

## Presets and Advanced Options
Add presets only after baseline hierarchy is accepted.

Reason:
- presets multiply test cases
- early presets hide unresolved hierarchy issues

## Drift Signals (When to Pause and Reset)
If two or more happen, pause and reset to this playbook:
- repeated small visual tweaks without a stable baseline
- same screen re-ordered many times without state-matrix update
- frequent subjective debate without screenshot-based checkpoints
- regression fixes appear faster than new feature progress

## Team Split
Recommended ownership:
- Assistant:
  - branch/PR flow
  - implementation batches
  - ADB screenshots/log capture
  - validation command execution
  - release notes / handoff docs
- User:
  - physical-device readiness (trainer wake, environment state)
  - real riding ergonomics judgement
  - final product priority and go/no-go decisions

## Reminder Rule
When workflow drifts, the assistant should explicitly say:
"We are drifting from the UI workflow playbook. I recommend resetting to: context -> state matrix -> baseline layout -> validation loop."

# ADB Cheatsheet (ErgometerApp)

This file contains practical `adb` commands for daily development and debugging on a USB-connected Android device.

## Prerequisites
- USB debugging enabled on device.
- Device is authorized for this host.
- Check connection:

```bash
adb devices -l
```

Expected: device listed with state `device`.

## Project Constants
- App package: `com.example.ergometerapp`
- Main activity: `com.example.ergometerapp.MainActivity`

## Build + Install

Build debug APK:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Install (replace existing):

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Install preserving app data (usually same as `-r`):

```bash
adb install -r -d app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Launch / Stop App

Start app:

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.example.ergometerapp/.MainActivity
```

Force-stop app:

```bash
adb shell am force-stop com.example.ergometerapp
```

Clear app data (fresh state):

```bash
adb shell pm clear com.example.ergometerapp
```

## Logs (Logcat)

Clear old logs:

```bash
adb logcat -c
```

Show live logs:

```bash
adb logcat
```

Show app process logs only:

```bash
adb logcat --pid "$(adb shell pidof -s com.example.ergometerapp)"
```

Show useful BLE tags (example):

```bash
adb logcat | rg "FTMS|BluetoothGatt|BluetoothLeScanner|SESSION|WORKOUT"
```

## Files and Exported FIT Artifacts

List app files (debuggable build context-dependent):

```bash
adb shell run-as com.example.ergometerapp ls -la files
```

Pull one internal app file:

```bash
adb exec-out run-as com.example.ergometerapp cat files/<filename> > ./<filename>
```

Pull from public storage path (if export target is public):

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/Download/<filename> .
```

## Screenshots and Screen Recording

Take screenshot:

```bash
adb exec-out screencap -p > screenshot.png
```

Record screen (30 sec max in this example):

```bash
adb shell screenrecord --time-limit 30 /sdcard/Download/ergometer-record.mp4
adb pull /sdcard/Download/ergometer-record.mp4 .
```

Use the helper script to capture screenshot + recording in one command:

```bash
./scripts/adb/capture.sh --serial R92Y40YAZPB --seconds 10
```

## Input Automation (Quick Smoke Actions)

Tap at coordinates:

```bash
adb shell input tap 500 1200
```

Swipe:

```bash
adb shell input swipe 500 1600 500 600 300
```

Type text:

```bash
adb shell input text "140"
```

Back key:

```bash
adb shell input keyevent 4
```

## Instrumentation Tests

Run all androidTests:

```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest --no-daemon
```

Run one instrumentation test class:

```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.example.ergometerapp.ui.MainActivityContentFlowTest \
  --no-daemon
```

## Device Diagnostics

Battery status:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys battery
```

Current foreground activity:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys activity activities | rg "mResumedActivity|topResumedActivity"
```

Bluetooth manager state:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager
```

## Multi-Device Tip
If multiple devices are connected, target one serial explicitly:

```bash
adb -s <serial> <command>
```

Example:

```bash
adb -s R92Y40YAZPB shell getprop ro.product.model
```

## Project Helper Script (Recommended)

Use the included helper for filtered ErgometerApp logs:

```bash
./scripts/adb/logcat-ergometer.sh --clear
```

Use app-process-only logging (best signal/noise during active app testing):

```bash
./scripts/adb/logcat-ergometer.sh --pid-only --clear
```

Dump current filtered logs to file and exit:

```bash
./scripts/adb/logcat-ergometer.sh --dump
```

Use specific device serial and custom output path:

```bash
./scripts/adb/logcat-ergometer.sh \
  --serial R92Y40YAZPB \
  --clear \
  --output .local/logs/ergometer-session.log
```

## One-command Device Smoke Pipeline

Run install + clean-state + connected tests + log capture + artifact collection:

```bash
./scripts/adb/device-smoke.sh
```

Run all instrumentation tests (not only smoke class):

```bash
./scripts/adb/device-smoke.sh --all-tests
```

Run with explicit device and optional short screen recording:

```bash
./scripts/adb/device-smoke.sh \
  --serial R92Y40YAZPB \
  --record-seconds 20
```

Artifacts are written under `.local/device-test-runs/run-<timestamp>/`:
- `logcat.log`
- `run-summary.txt`
- `androidTest-results/*.xml`
- `reports/androidTests-connected-debug/`
- optional `final-screen.png` and `screenrecord.mp4`

## One-command Emulator Smoke Pipeline (Fast Regression)

Use the local emulator helper when you want fast UI/state regression checks without using the USB tablet:

```bash
./scripts/adb/emulator-smoke.sh
```

Create/verify the default AVD only (no boot, no tests):

```bash
./scripts/adb/emulator-smoke.sh --create-only
```

Run full instrumentation suite on emulator:

```bash
./scripts/adb/emulator-smoke.sh --all-tests
```

Run emulator smoke including tests marked `@FlakyTest`:

```bash
./scripts/adb/emulator-smoke.sh --include-flaky
```

Keep emulator process alive after the run (useful when iterating repeatedly):

```bash
./scripts/adb/emulator-smoke.sh --keep-running
```

Artifacts are written under `.local/emulator-test-runs/run-<timestamp>/`:
- `emulator.log`
- `logcat.log`
- `run-summary.txt`
- `androidTest-results/*.xml`
- `reports/androidTests-connected-debug/`
- `final-screen.png`

Notes:
- This emulator pipeline is for UI/Compose/instrumentation regressions.
- By default, emulator smoke excludes tests annotated with `@FlakyTest`; use `--include-flaky` when needed.
- Local emulator smoke run artifacts include flaky policy fields in `run-summary.txt` (`exclude_flaky`, `include_flaky`).
- BLE trainer behavior (FTMS/Tunturi) must still be validated on real hardware with `./scripts/adb/device-smoke.sh`.
- If both USB device and emulator are connected, emulator runs stay deterministic because the script pins test execution via `ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-<port>`.
- If you see `avdmanager` or `sdkmanager` missing errors, install **Android SDK Command-line Tools** from Android Studio: `Settings > Android SDK > SDK Tools`.

GitHub smoke policy:
- PR checks do not run emulator smoke by default (keeps PR gate fast and stable).
- Nightly smoke (`04:30 UTC`) includes tests annotated with `@FlakyTest`.
- Manual workflow dispatch runs emulator smoke only when explicitly requested and can include flaky tests via workflow input.
- GitHub smoke uploads `smoke-policy.txt` plus instrumentation reports as run artifacts.
